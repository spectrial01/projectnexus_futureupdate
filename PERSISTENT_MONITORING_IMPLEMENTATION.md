# Persistent Monitoring and Alerts Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of persistent monitoring and alerts to address the bug where notifications and alarms can be easily dismissed by users on newer versions of Android, making the watchdog service less effective.

## Problem Statement

**Bug**: On some newer versions of Android, notifications and alarms can be easily dismissed by the user. This could cause the `watchdog_service.dart` to be less effective.

**Impact**: Users could accidentally or intentionally disable critical monitoring services, leading to:
- Loss of device tracking
- Missed critical alerts
- Compromised security monitoring
- Reduced service reliability

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Watchdog Service with Foreground Service

The watchdog service has been enhanced to run as a foreground service with persistent notifications that are much harder for users to dismiss accidentally or intentionally.

#### Key Features:
- **Persistent Notifications**: Uses `ongoing: true` and `autoCancel: false` to prevent dismissal
- **Full Screen Intent**: Shows even when device is locked (`fullScreenIntent: true`)
- **High Priority**: Uses `Importance.max` and `Priority.max` for maximum visibility
- **Enhanced Channels**: Separate notification channels for different alert types
- **Action Buttons**: Interactive notification actions for service management

#### Notification Types:
1. **Persistent Service Notification** (ID: 1001)
   - Always visible while service is running
   - Updates every 30 seconds with current status
   - Cannot be dismissed by user

2. **Warning Notifications** (ID: 1002)
   - Triggered when no heartbeat for 10+ minutes
   - Orange color with vibration pattern
   - Requires immediate attention

3. **Critical Alerts** (ID: 1003)
   - Triggered when app is considered "dead"
   - Red color with aggressive vibration and sound
   - Impossible to miss

### 2. Foreground Service Integration

The watchdog service now integrates with the background service to ensure it runs with proper system priority:

```dart
// Initialize foreground service
Future<void> _initializeForegroundService() async {
  try {
    final service = FlutterBackgroundService();
    final isRunning = await service.isRunning();
    
    if (!isRunning) {
      await service.startService();
      print('WatchdogService: Background service started for watchdog');
    }
    
    _isForegroundService = true;
  } catch (e) {
    print('WatchdogService: Error initializing foreground service: $e');
    _isForegroundService = false;
  }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Health Monitoring

The watchdog service now provides more granular health monitoring:

- **5-minute intervals**: Heartbeat every 5 minutes
- **10-minute warning**: Warning notification if no heartbeat for 10+ minutes
- **15-minute critical**: App considered dead after 15 minutes without heartbeat
- **Real-time status**: Continuous health score and status updates

### 4. Persistent Monitoring Configuration

A new configuration system has been implemented to help users properly configure their devices:

#### Configuration Requirements:
1. **Battery Optimization Disabled** (Critical)
   - Prevents system from killing background services
   - Ensures watchdog service can run continuously

2. **Auto-Start Enabled** (High)
   - App launches automatically after device restart
   - Maintains monitoring continuity

3. **Notification Access Granted** (High)
   - Ensures critical alerts can be displayed
   - Prevents system from blocking notifications

4. **Background Restrictions Disabled** (Critical)
   - Removes system-imposed background limitations
   - Allows watchdog service to run unrestricted

5. **Watchdog Priority Set** (Critical)
   - Service automatically configured for high priority
   - Persistent notification ensures visibility

#### Health Scoring System:
- **100/100**: Optimal - All safeguards enabled
- **80-99**: Good - Most safeguards enabled
- **60-79**: Fair - Some safeguards enabled
- **40-59**: Poor - Few safeguards enabled
- **0-39**: Critical - No safeguards enabled

### 5. Device-Specific Instructions

Comprehensive instructions for different Android manufacturers:

- **Xiaomi/MIUI**: Security > Permissions > Autostart
- **Huawei/EMUI**: Battery > Launch > Manage manually
- **Samsung/One UI**: Device care > Battery > App power management
- **OPPO/ColorOS**: Battery > App battery management
- **Vivo/Funtouch OS**: Battery > App battery management

### 6. User Interface Integration

The persistent monitoring configuration is integrated into the dashboard:

- **Health Score Display**: Visual representation of monitoring status
- **Requirements Checklist**: Expandable items with step-by-step instructions
- **Required Actions**: Clear list of actions needed for optimal monitoring
- **Monitoring Tips**: Best practices for maintaining service reliability
- **Emergency Recovery**: Steps to take if monitoring stops
