# Intelligent Location Tracking System

## Overview

The Intelligent Location Tracking System is a battery-optimized solution that dramatically reduces power consumption by using device motion sensors to determine when location updates are necessary. Instead of sending location updates at fixed intervals, the system intelligently adapts based on whether the device is moving or stationary.

## Key Benefits

- **Up to 70% battery savings** when device is stationary
- **Maintains accuracy** during active movement
- **Adaptive tracking intervals** based on motion state
- **Real-time motion detection** using multiple sensors
- **Configurable sensitivity** for different use cases

## How It Works

### 1. Motion Detection
The system uses three primary sensors to detect device movement:

- **Accelerometer**: Detects linear acceleration and movement
- **Gyroscope**: Detects rotational movement and orientation changes
- **User Accelerometer**: Gravity-filtered acceleration for user-initiated motion

### 2. Intelligent Intervals
Location update frequency automatically adjusts based on motion state:

- **Moving**: High-frequency updates (configurable, default: 5 seconds)
- **Recently Stationary**: Medium-frequency updates (configurable, default: 5 seconds)
- **Truly Stationary**: Low-frequency updates (configurable, default: 5 seconds)

### 3. Motion Analysis
The system uses advanced algorithms to determine motion state:

- **Variance Analysis**: Calculates acceleration variance over time
- **Buffer Management**: Maintains rolling buffers of sensor data
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides motion detection confidence levels
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjusts sensitivity based on usage patterns

### Data Flow

```
Device Sensors → Motion Detection → Interval Calculation → Location Updates
     ↓              ↓                    ↓                ↓
Accelerometer → Motion State → Optimal Interval → GPS + Server
Gyroscope    → Confidence   → Timer Management → Battery + Signal
User Accel   → Thresholds   → Skip Logic      → Session Validation
```

## Configuration Options

### Motion Detection Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Motion Threshold | 0.1 - 2.0 m/s² | 0.5 m/s² | Sensitivity to acceleration changes |
| Stationary Timeout | 1 - 30 minutes | 5 minutes | Time before device is considered stationary |
| Motion Sensitivity | 50% - 200% | 100% | Multiplier for motion threshold |

### Location Tracking Settings

| Setting | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| Moving Interval | 5 seconds | 5 seconds | Updates when device is moving |
| Stationary Interval | 5 seconds | 5 seconds | Updates when device is stationary |
| Default Interval | 5 seconds | 5 seconds | Fixed interval when motion tracking disabled |

## Implementation Details

### Motion Detection Algorithm

```dart
bool _detectMotion(double stdDev) {
  // Primary motion detection using acceleration variance
  final accelerationMotion = stdDev > _motionThreshold * _motionSensitivity;
  
  // Secondary motion detection using gyroscope
  bool gyroscopeMotion = false;
  if (_gyroscopeBuffer.length >= _bufferSize) {
    final gyroMean = _gyroscopeBuffer.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / _gyroscopeBuffer.length;
    gyroscopeMotion = gyroMean > 0.1; // 0.1 rad/s threshold
  }
  
  // Combined motion detection
  return accelerationMotion || gyroscopeMotion;
}
```

### Interval Optimization

```dart
Duration _getOptimalTrackingInterval() {
  if (!_enableMotionTracking) {
    return _locationInterval; // Use default if disabled
  }
  
  if (_isCurrentlyMoving) {
    return _motionInterval; // More frequent when moving
  } else {
    if (_motionService.isTrulyStationary) {
      return _stationaryInterval; // Much less frequent when stationary
    } else {
      return _locationInterval; // Default when recently stationary
    }
  }
}
```
